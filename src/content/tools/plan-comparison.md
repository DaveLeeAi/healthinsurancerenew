  - question: "Which plan level is best?"
    answer: "There is no single best plan level. The right choice depends on your healthcare needs, budget, and whether you qualify for cost-sharing reductions, which only apply to Silver plans."

## What This Tool Does

This tool provides an educational comparison of ACA metal tier plan levels. The Affordable Care Act organizes marketplace health insurance into four metal tiers -- Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum -- each representing a different balance between monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs when receiving care.

Bronze plans cover approximately 60% of average healthcare costs, leaving 40% to the enrollee. Silver plans cover about 70%, Gold about 80%, and Platinum about 90%. A key distinction is that cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) are available only with Silver plans for eligible lower-income households, which can significantly reduce deductibles and copays beyond what the standard Silver tier offers.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Review the side-by-side breakdown of each metal tier to compare typical premium ranges, deductible levels, copay structures, and out-of-pocket maximums. The tool highlights the trade-offs between paying more each month in premiums versus paying more at the point of care.

Results also explain how cost-sharing reductions interact specifically with Silver plans and why that feature can make Silver the most cost-effective option for many households.
