## What This Calculator Does

This calculator provides an educational estimate of how household income may affect ACA marketplace premium tax credits. By entering basic income and household information, the tool generates an approximate view of potential monthly savings on health insurance premiums.

The Affordable Care Act ties premium tax credit amounts to household income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Households earning between 100% and 400% of the FPL -- and in many cases above that threshold under extended subsidy rules -- may receive credits that lower monthly premium costs. This calculator models those relationships so users can better understand how income changes might influence financial assistance.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Start by entering total expected household income for the coverage year and the number of people in the household. The calculator then estimates where that income falls relative to the Federal Poverty Level and displays an approximate premium tax credit amount.

Results include an estimated monthly subsidy, an approximate percentage of income expected to go toward a benchmark plan premium, and a comparison showing costs with and without the estimated credit.
