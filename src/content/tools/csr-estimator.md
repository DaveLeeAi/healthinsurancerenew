faqs:
  - question: "What are cost-sharing reductions and how do they work?"
    answer: "Cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) are ACA benefits that lower out-of-pocket costs on Silver marketplace plans. When eligible, the insurance company reduces deductibles, copays, and maximum out-of-pocket limits. CSRs are only available on Silver-tier plans and are based on household income relative to the Federal Poverty Level."
  - question: "Do I need to apply separately for cost-sharing reductions?"
    answer: "No. When enrolling in a marketplace plan, eligibility for cost-sharing reductions is determined automatically based on the income information provided in the application. If eligible, CSR benefits are applied only when a Silver plan is selected."
  - question: "Can I get cost-sharing reductions on Bronze or Gold plans?"
    answer: "No. Cost-sharing reductions are exclusively available on Silver-tier marketplace plans. Choosing a Bronze, Gold, or Platinum plan means forgoing CSR benefits even if income would otherwise qualify."

## What This Tool Does

This estimator helps individuals and families understand whether their household income may qualify for ACA cost-sharing reductions. CSRs are a significant but often overlooked benefit that can dramatically reduce healthcare costs beyond what premium tax credits provide. The tool calculates income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level and shows what level of cost-sharing reduction may apply.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Enter household size and annual income to see an estimated CSR tier. The tool displays approximate deductible amounts, out-of-pocket maximums, and typical copay levels for each eligibility tier. Results compare the enhanced Silver plan benefits against a standard Silver plan to illustrate the potential savings.

### Educational Disclaimer

This is an educational estimate and not a guarantee of eligibility. Actual cost-sharing reduction levels are determined by the Health Insurance Marketplace based on verified income and household information. Plan-specific costs vary by insurer and region.
