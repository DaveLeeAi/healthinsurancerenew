## What This Tool Does

This tool helps determine whether an employer-sponsored health plan meets the ACA affordability standard. The ACA defines employer coverage as affordable when the employee-only premium for the lowest-cost plan does not exceed a set percentage of household income -- approximately 9.02% for 2026.

Understanding this threshold matters because access to affordable employer coverage generally affects eligibility for marketplace premium tax credits. If employer-sponsored insurance is considered affordable under ACA rules, household members covered by that offer typically cannot receive marketplace subsidies. Conversely, if the employer plan exceeds the affordability threshold, marketplace options with financial assistance may become available.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Enter the monthly employee-only premium cost for the employer plan and the household's estimated annual income. The tool then calculates the premium as a percentage of income and compares it against the current affordability threshold.

Results display whether the employer plan falls above or below the ACA affordability standard, the exact percentage of income the premium represents, and general information about what that determination may mean for marketplace eligibility.
