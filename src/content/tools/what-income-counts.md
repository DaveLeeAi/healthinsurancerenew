## What This Tool Does

This tool explains which types of income are counted when determining eligibility for ACA health insurance subsidies. The ACA uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) as its primary income measure, and understanding what MAGI includes is an important step in estimating potential financial assistance.

MAGI starts with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from a federal tax return and adds back three specific items: non-taxable Social Security benefits, tax-exempt interest income, and foreign earned income that was excluded from AGI. Common income sources included in AGI -- and therefore in MAGI -- are wages, salary, self-employment income, retirement distributions, investment income, and alimony received under pre-2019 agreements.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Select or review each income category to see whether it typically counts toward MAGI. The tool walks through common income types, identifies which ones are included, and provides brief explanations for each category.

Results offer a clearer picture of which income sources generally factor into ACA subsidy calculations and which are typically excluded, such as gifts, veterans' disability payments, and child support received.
