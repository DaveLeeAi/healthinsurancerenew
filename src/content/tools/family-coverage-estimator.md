faqs:
  - question: "How are family health insurance premiums calculated on the marketplace?"
    answer: "Marketplace premiums are based on the ages of household members, location, tobacco use, and the plan selected. Premium tax credits reduce the cost based on household income relative to the Federal Poverty Level. The subsidy is calculated using the second-lowest-cost Silver plan as a benchmark."
  - question: "Are children covered differently than adults on marketplace plans?"
    answer: "Children under 21 generally have lower base premiums than adults. Up to three children of the same age are rated, meaning families with more than three children of similar ages do not pay additional premiums for the fourth child and beyond."
  - question: "Can a family save money by splitting into separate marketplace applications?"
    answer: "In some cases, married couples may find that filing separately or exploring different coverage combinations could affect subsidy eligibility. However, this depends on specific tax filing circumstances and income levels. Consulting with a licensed agent or navigator is recommended."

## What This Tool Does

This estimator helps families understand the approximate monthly cost of ACA marketplace health insurance based on their household composition and income. It calculates the expected premium contribution as a percentage of income and estimates the potential premium tax credit that may reduce monthly costs across different plan tiers.

## How to Use It and What It Shows

Select the number of adults and children in the household, enter total annual household income, and choose a plan tier. The tool displays estimated monthly premiums before and after potential subsidies, showing the approximate out-of-pocket cost for coverage. Results include comparisons across Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers.
