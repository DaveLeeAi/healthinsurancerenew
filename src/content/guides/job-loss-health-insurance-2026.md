title: "Lost Your Job in 2026? Your Health Insurance Options Explained"
description: "A clear guide to health insurance after losing your job in 2026. Covers COBRA, marketplace special enrollment, Medicaid, cost comparisons, and the deadlines you need to know."
datePublished: "2025-10-15"

keyTakeaways:
  - "Losing employer coverage triggers a 60-day Special Enrollment Period to sign up for an ACA marketplace plan."
  - "COBRA lets you keep your old plan, but you pay the full premium -- often $600 to $700 a month for one person."
  - "A marketplace plan with subsidies usually costs much less than COBRA, especially if your income has dropped."
  - "If your income is low enough, you may qualify for Medicaid, which has little to no monthly cost."
  - "You have 60 days from losing coverage to act. Missing this window means waiting until the next open enrollment."
faqs:
  - question: "How long do I have to sign up for new coverage after losing my job?"
    answer: "You have 60 days from the date you lose your job-based health coverage to enroll in a marketplace plan through a Special Enrollment Period. COBRA also gives you 60 days to elect continuation coverage. These windows are firm, so it is important to start looking into options right away."
  - question: "Is COBRA always more expensive than a marketplace plan?"
    answer: "In most cases, yes. COBRA requires paying the full premium your employer used to help cover, plus a 2% administrative fee. Marketplace plans with premium tax credits are almost always cheaper, especially if your income has decreased after losing your job. The exception is if you have already met a large deductible on your employer plan that year."
  - question: "Can I get Medicaid if I lose my job?"
    answer: "It depends on your income and your state. In states that have expanded Medicaid, adults with income below about 138% of the Federal Poverty Level may qualify. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, the income threshold is much lower. You can check your eligibility by applying through Healthcare.gov or your state marketplace."
  - question: "What if I get a new job soon -- should I just go without insurance?"
    answer: "Going without coverage is risky. An unexpected medical event could result in thousands of dollars in bills. A short-term marketplace plan or COBRA can bridge the gap. If the new job offers health benefits, there is typically a waiting period of up to 90 days before employer coverage begins."

## Your Three Main Options

When you lose your job and the health insurance that came with it, you generally have three paths: continue your employer plan through COBRA, sign up for a marketplace plan, or apply for Medicaid. Each option has different costs, coverage levels, and deadlines. Understanding the differences helps you pick the one that fits your situation and budget.

The most important thing to know is that you have a limited time to act. Losing job-based coverage opens a 60-day window called a Special Enrollment Period. If you miss it, you may not be able to get coverage until the next open enrollment season.

## COBRA: Keeping Your Old Plan

COBRA lets you stay on your employer's health plan for up to 18 months after leaving your job. The coverage stays the same -- same doctors, same benefits, same network. But the cost changes dramatically. While you were employed, your employer likely paid 70% to 80% of the premium. Under COBRA, you pay the entire amount, plus a 2% administrative fee.

For a single person, that typically means $600 to $750 per month. For a family, it can easily top $1,700 per month. COBRA makes sense in a few specific situations: if you are in the middle of treatment with a specific doctor, if you have already met a large deductible that year, or if a severance package covers COBRA costs.

## Marketplace Plans: Often the Better Deal

The ACA marketplace (Healthcare.gov or your state exchange) offers health plans with potential savings based on your income. After losing your job, your projected annual income for the year may be lower, which means you could qualify for larger premium tax credits that bring your monthly cost well below COBRA rates.

A single adult projecting $35,000 in annual income might pay under $200 per month for a Silver marketplace plan, compared to $650 or more for COBRA. If your income has dropped significantly, you could qualify for even larger savings, or potentially Medicaid.

To enroll, visit Healthcare.gov or your state exchange, report the loss of employer coverage, and provide your estimated income for the year. The system will show you available plans and your estimated monthly cost after any credits are applied.

## Medicaid: Free or Very Low-Cost Coverage

If your income after job loss is low enough, you may qualify for Medicaid. In states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, single adults with annual income below about $21,597 (138% of the Federal Poverty Level for 2026) generally qualify. A family of four may qualify with income below about $44,367.

Medicaid coverage has little to no monthly premiums and very low out-of-pocket costs. In many states, the application process happens automatically when you apply through the marketplace -- if your income qualifies, you are redirected to your state's Medicaid program.

Not all states have expanded Medicaid. In non-expansion states, adults without children may not qualify even at very low income levels.

## Cost Comparison at a Glance

The actual numbers depend on your income, family size, and location, but here is a general picture for a single adult:

- **COBRA**: $600 to $750 per month (full premium, no help from employer)
- **Marketplace Silver plan with subsidies**: $50 to $300 per month (varies by income)
- **Medicaid**: $0 to minimal per month (if income qualifies)

## Deadlines That Matter

- **60 days** from losing coverage: deadline to enroll in a marketplace plan through a Special Enrollment Period
- **60 days** from COBRA election notice: deadline to elect COBRA continuation
- **No deadline for Medicaid**: you can apply any time of year if you think you may qualify
- **COBRA is retroactive**: you can elect it within 60 days and it covers you back to the date you lost employer coverage

The safest approach is to research marketplace options immediately and make a decision within the first few weeks. Waiting until the end of the 60-day window risks missing the deadline if anything goes wrong with the application.
