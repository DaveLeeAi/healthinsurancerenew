faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between individual health insurance and employer-sponsored coverage?"
    answer: "Individual health insurance is purchased directly through the ACA marketplace or a private insurer, while employer-sponsored coverage is offered and partially funded by an employer. Both must meet ACA minimum essential coverage standards, but individual plans may be eligible for premium tax credits based on household income."
  - question: "Can a family mix and match different marketplace plans?"
    answer: "Yes, members of the same household can enroll in different marketplace plans. Each family member can select a plan that best fits their provider preferences and expected medical needs, though premium tax credits are calculated for the household as a whole."
  - question: "Are all ACA marketplace plans required to cover pre-existing conditions?"
    answer: "Yes. Under the Affordable Care Act, all marketplace plans must accept applicants regardless of pre-existing conditions and cannot charge higher premiums based on health status."

## What Is Individual & Family Health Insurance?

Individual and family health insurance is coverage purchased by a person or household rather than obtained through an employer or government program. These plans are available year-round through qualifying life events or during the annual open enrollment period via the ACA marketplace, also known as the Health Insurance Exchange.

## How the ACA Marketplace Works

The ACA marketplace is a federally facilitated or state-run exchange where consumers can compare and purchase health insurance plans. All plans sold on the marketplace are required to cover ten essential health benefits, including hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, and preventive services. Plans are organized into four metal tiers -- Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum -- each representing a different balance between monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs.

## Understanding Metal Tiers

Metal tiers indicate how costs are shared between the insurer and the covered individual. Bronze plans carry the lowest monthly premiums but the highest out-of-pocket costs when care is needed. Platinum plans have the highest premiums but cover a greater share of medical expenses. Silver plans hold a unique position because they are the only tier eligible for cost-sharing reductions, which lower deductibles and copays for qualifying households.

## Who Should Consider Marketplace Coverage?

Marketplace plans serve individuals and families who do not have access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance or government programs like Medicaid. Self-employed workers, early retirees, part-time employees, and anyone experiencing a gap in employer coverage are among those who commonly turn to the marketplace. Financial assistance in the form of premium tax credits is available to households with income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, and in some years, expanded eligibility removes that upper cap entirely.
