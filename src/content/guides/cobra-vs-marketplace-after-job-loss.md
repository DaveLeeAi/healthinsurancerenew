title: "COBRA vs. ACA Marketplace After Losing Your Job: Which Is Better in 2026?"
description: "Compare COBRA continuation coverage with ACA marketplace plans after job loss. Understand costs, timelines, and how to choose the most affordable option for your situation."
datePublished: "2025-10-15"
dateModified: "2026-02-21"
keyTakeaways:
  - "COBRA lets you keep your employer plan but at the full cost, which is typically $600 to $700 per month for an individual and $1,700 or more for a family, plus a 2% administrative fee."
  - "Losing job-based coverage qualifies for a 60-day Special Enrollment Period on the ACA marketplace, where premium tax credits may significantly reduce monthly costs."
  - "For most people losing employer coverage, an ACA marketplace plan with subsidies costs substantially less per month than COBRA continuation."
  - "COBRA is available for up to 18 months after a qualifying event, while marketplace plans can be renewed annually without time limits."
  - "Individuals mid-treatment with a specific provider should check whether that provider is available on marketplace plans before leaving COBRA."
faqs:
  - question: "Can I switch from COBRA to a marketplace plan later?"
    answer: "Yes. Voluntarily dropping COBRA coverage triggers a special enrollment period on the marketplace because it counts as a loss of qualifying coverage. However, this option is available only once, so timing matters. COBRA can also serve as temporary bridge coverage while researching marketplace options."
  - question: "Is COBRA coverage better than marketplace coverage?"
    answer: "COBRA provides the same plan you had while employed, so there is no change in doctors, hospitals, or formulary. However, the cost is almost always higher than a subsidized marketplace plan because the employer no longer pays a portion of the premium. For most people, marketplace plans with premium tax credits are more affordable."
  - question: "What if I have a pre-existing condition? Does that affect my choice?"
    answer: "Both COBRA and ACA marketplace plans are required to cover pre-existing conditions without exclusions or waiting periods. The ACA eliminated pre-existing condition discrimination for all marketplace-compliant plans, so this should not be a deciding factor between the two options."

## Understanding COBRA After Job Loss

COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) allows employees who lose their job-based health coverage to continue the same group health plan for a limited period, typically up to 18 months. The critical difference is cost: while employed, the employer typically pays 70% to 80% of the health insurance premium. Under COBRA, the former employee pays 100% of the premium plus a 2% administrative fee.

For an individual, COBRA premiums commonly range from $600 to $750 per month. For a family, premiums frequently exceed $1,700 per month. These costs represent the full, unsubsidized price of group health insurance and can be a significant financial burden during a period of reduced or no income.

## ACA Marketplace as an Alternative

Losing employer-sponsored health coverage is a qualifying life event that triggers a 60-day Special Enrollment Period on the ACA marketplace. During this window, individuals and families can enroll in marketplace plans and may qualify for premium tax credits based on their projected annual income for the coverage year.

With reduced income after job loss, many individuals find that marketplace subsidies reduce premiums to well below COBRA costs. A single adult projecting $35,000 in annual income, for example, may pay under $200 per month for a Silver marketplace plan, compared to $650 or more for COBRA. The subsidy is based on projected income for the full year, so a period of unemployment is factored into the calculation.

## Side-by-Side Cost Comparison

When comparing COBRA and marketplace options, calculate total annual costs including premiums, deductibles, and expected out-of-pocket spending. COBRA maintains the same deductible progress from the employer plan, which can be valuable if significant medical expenses have already been incurred during the year. Starting a new marketplace plan resets the deductible.

For individuals with minimal healthcare needs, a marketplace Bronze or Silver plan with subsidies is almost always more affordable than COBRA. For those mid-treatment or with high accumulated deductible spending, a brief period of COBRA followed by a marketplace transition may optimize total costs.

## Timeline and Decision Points

After receiving a COBRA election notice, individuals have 60 days to elect COBRA coverage, and this period overlaps with the marketplace special enrollment window. Importantly, COBRA can be elected retroactively within the 60-day window, providing a safety net for unexpected medical expenses during the decision period.

The recommended approach is to research marketplace options immediately after losing coverage, estimate subsidy eligibility using projected annual income, compare total costs against COBRA premiums, and make an enrollment decision before the 60-day window closes.

## When COBRA Makes Sense

COBRA may be the better choice in specific situations: when the employer plan has a narrow specialty provider needed for ongoing treatment, when significant deductible spending has already occurred in the current plan year, when the job loss is expected to be very short-term with quick re-employment, or when COBRA premiums are partially subsidized by a severance agreement.
