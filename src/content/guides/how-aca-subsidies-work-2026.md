title: "How ACA Subsidies Work in 2026: Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions"
description: "A breakdown of how ACA subsidies reduce health insurance costs in 2026, including how premium tax credits are calculated, what cost-sharing reductions cover, and how household income determines assistance levels."

keyTakeaways:
  - "Premium tax credits reduce monthly premiums and are available across all metal tiers."
  - "Cost-sharing reductions lower out-of-pocket costs but apply only to Silver plans."
  - "Both forms of assistance are based on household income relative to the federal poverty level."
  - "Advance credits are reconciled at tax time and may require repayment if income was underestimated."
faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions?"
    answer: "Premium tax credits lower the monthly premium paid for a marketplace plan and are available across all metal tiers. Cost-sharing reductions lower out-of-pocket costs like deductibles, copays, and coinsurance but apply only to Silver-tier plans. Both are based on household income relative to the federal poverty level."
  - question: "Do ACA subsidies need to be repaid?"
    answer: "Premium tax credits taken in advance are reconciled when a federal tax return is filed. If actual household income for the year was higher than the estimate provided during enrollment, some or all of the advance credit may need to be repaid. If income was lower than estimated, an additional credit may be received as a tax refund."
  - question: "Can someone receiving employer coverage still get marketplace subsidies?"
    answer: "Marketplace subsidies are generally unavailable to individuals who have access to employer-sponsored coverage that meets ACA affordability and minimum value standards. If employer coverage is deemed unaffordable -- meaning the employee's share of the premium exceeds a set percentage of household income -- marketplace subsidies may become available."

## What Are ACA Subsidies?

ACA subsidies are financial assistance programs established by the Affordable Care Act to make marketplace health insurance more affordable. Two primary forms exist: premium tax credits, which reduce monthly premiums, and cost-sharing reductions, which lower out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and copays.

## How Premium Tax Credits Are Calculated

Premium tax credits are calculated based on household income as a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL). The subsidy ensures that the cost of a benchmark Silver plan does not exceed a set percentage of income. Households with lower incomes pay a smaller share, while those with higher incomes receive proportionally less assistance. The credit can be applied in advance to reduce monthly premium payments or claimed in full when filing a federal tax return.

## Understanding Cost-Sharing Reductions

Cost-sharing reductions are available exclusively on Silver-tier marketplace plans. These reductions lower the plan's deductible, copayments, and maximum out-of-pocket limits, effectively increasing the plan's actuarial value. Eligibility is generally tied to household incomes between 100% and 250% of the FPL. Unlike premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions do not require reconciliation at tax time.

## What to Watch for in 2026

Subsidy availability in 2026 depends on current federal legislation. Enhanced premium tax credits, which removed the income cap and reduced the maximum percentage of income spent on benchmark premiums, were introduced as temporary measures. Whether these enhancements remain active for the 2026 plan year directly affects how much financial assistance is available. Checking updated subsidy calculators during open enrollment provides the most accurate estimate of expected costs.
