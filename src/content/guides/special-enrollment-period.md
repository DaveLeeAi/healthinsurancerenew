keyTakeaways:
  - "Special enrollment periods let you sign up outside the annual open enrollment window."
  - "Most qualifying life events give you 60 days to enroll in a new plan."
  - "Common triggers include losing coverage, marriage, having a baby, or moving to a new state."
  - "Documentation may be required to verify the qualifying life event."
faqs:
  - question: "How long does a special enrollment period last?"
    answer: "Most special enrollment periods last 60 days from the date of the qualifying life event. Some events, such as losing Medicaid coverage, may carry different timelines. Acting promptly is important because coverage cannot be backdated, and delays may result in gaps."
  - question: "Can a change in income trigger a special enrollment period?"
    answer: "A change in income alone does not typically trigger a special enrollment period. However, if a drop in income results in gaining or losing eligibility for Medicaid or marketplace subsidies, that change in eligibility status may open an enrollment window."
  - question: "Is documentation required to verify a qualifying life event?"
    answer: "Yes, the marketplace may request documentation to verify the qualifying life event. Examples include a termination letter from an employer for job-based coverage loss, a marriage certificate, a birth certificate, or proof of a new address. Submitting documents promptly helps avoid delays in coverage activation."

## What Is a Special Enrollment Period?

A special enrollment period (SEP) is a window outside the standard open enrollment period during which individuals and families can sign up for or change ACA marketplace health insurance. Access to an SEP is triggered by specific qualifying life events that alter a household's coverage needs or circumstances.

## Common Qualifying Life Events

Qualifying life events fall into several broad categories. Loss of existing health coverage -- whether through job loss, aging off a parent's plan, or losing Medicaid eligibility -- is among the most common triggers. Major life changes such as marriage, divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, and a permanent move to a new zip code or county also establish eligibility. Each event type has its own documentation requirements and enrollment timeline.

## How to Enroll During a Special Enrollment Period

Enrollment during an SEP follows the same general process as open enrollment. An application is submitted through the marketplace, qualifying event details are reported, and the marketplace verifies eligibility. Once verified, available plans can be compared and selected. Coverage start dates depend on when the plan is selected relative to the qualifying event and the time of month.

## Important Timing Considerations

Deadlines are strict during a special enrollment period. Most SEPs allow 60 days from the qualifying event to complete enrollment. Reporting the event to the marketplace as early as possible preserves the full window for plan comparison and selection. Coverage effective dates vary -- enrolling between the 1st and 15th of a month typically triggers coverage on the 1st of the following month, while enrolling after the 15th may push the start date to the 1st of the month after that.
