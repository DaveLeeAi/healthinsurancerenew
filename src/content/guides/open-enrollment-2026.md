faqs:
  - question: "What happens if the open enrollment deadline is missed?"
    answer: "Missing the open enrollment deadline means marketplace coverage cannot be obtained until the next enrollment period unless a qualifying life event triggers a special enrollment period. Examples of qualifying events include losing other health coverage, getting married, having a baby, or moving to a new state."
  - question: "Do existing marketplace enrollees need to re-enroll every year?"
    answer: "Existing enrollees are typically auto-renewed into their current plan or a similar plan if theirs is discontinued. However, reviewing and actively updating a plan selection each year is strongly recommended, as premiums, provider networks, and formularies can change significantly from year to year."

## When Does Open Enrollment for 2026 Start?

The open enrollment period for 2026 ACA marketplace coverage is expected to begin on November 1, 2025, and run through January 15, 2026, on the federal exchange at HealthCare.gov. Some state-based marketplaces set their own deadlines, which may extend later into January or beyond. Enrolling by December 15 typically ensures coverage begins on January 1 of the new plan year.

## How the Enrollment Process Works

Enrollment begins with an application on the marketplace, which collects household size, income, and current coverage information. The application determines eligibility for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. From there, applicants can compare available plans by premium, deductible, provider network, and drug formulary before making a selection.

## What Changes to Expect in 2026

Plan availability, premiums, and subsidy amounts shift each year based on insurer participation and federal policy. For 2026, close attention should be paid to whether enhanced premium tax credits -- originally expanded under the American Rescue Plan and extended through subsequent legislation -- remain in effect. Changes to subsidy structure can significantly alter net premium costs, making it essential to re-shop rather than rely on auto-renewal.

## Steps to Prepare Before Enrollment Opens

Preparation improves outcomes during open enrollment. Gathering documents such as projected annual income, tax filing status, and a list of current medications and preferred providers helps streamline the comparison process. Reviewing the prior year's plan performance -- including unexpected out-of-pocket costs or network limitations -- offers practical insight into what to prioritize in a new plan selection.
