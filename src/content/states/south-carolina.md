## Health Insurance Options in South Carolina

South Carolina residents access ACA Marketplace coverage through Healthcare.gov. The state has not expanded Medicaid, which means a larger portion of the population depends on the Marketplace for individual health coverage. Multiple insurers participate in South Carolina's exchange, with plan availability varying by county and rating area. Plans are organized into the standard metal tiers, and all must cover the ACA's essential health benefits. Residents in both urban areas like Charleston and Columbia and more rural regions can compare options through the federal platform.

## How to Enroll in a South Carolina Marketplace Plan

Enrollment occurs at Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment period, typically from November 1 through January 15. The application requires household composition and income information to assess eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, or Marketplace premium tax credits. After completing the application, residents can browse and compare plans based on premium, deductible, network, and estimated total annual costs. Special Enrollment Periods are available for qualifying life events. Licensed insurance agents and navigator organizations across South Carolina provide free assistance with enrollment.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in South Carolina

Premium tax credits are the primary form of financial assistance for South Carolina residents purchasing Marketplace coverage. The credit amount depends on household income and the cost of the benchmark Silver plan in the local area. Cost-sharing reductions for Silver plan enrollees with qualifying incomes further reduce deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximums. Without Medicaid expansion, these subsidies are especially critical for making coverage accessible. Reviewing estimated costs with and without subsidies during the enrollment process helps ensure the most informed plan selection.
