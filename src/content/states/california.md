## Health Insurance Options in California

California operates its own state-based exchange, Covered California, which serves as the primary marketplace for individual and family health insurance. The state has fully expanded Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal in California), providing coverage to a broad low-income population. Covered California offers plans from multiple insurers across the state's 19 rating regions, giving residents a competitive selection of options. Plans follow the standard ACA metal tiers, and the exchange also offers enhanced plan options in some areas.

## How to Enroll in a Covered California Plan

Enrollment is handled directly through the Covered California website or by working with a certified insurance agent or enrollment counselor. The annual Open Enrollment period follows a schedule that may differ slightly from the federal marketplace timeline. Residents who experience qualifying life events can apply during a Special Enrollment Period. The Covered California application collects household size, income, and other details to determine eligibility for Medi-Cal or subsidized Marketplace coverage. In-person assistance is available at locations throughout the state.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in California

California residents may receive both federal and state-level financial assistance for health coverage. Federal premium tax credits are calculated based on income relative to the federal poverty level and the cost of the benchmark Silver plan in each region. California also funds its own subsidy program, which extends premium assistance to households with incomes above the federal threshold. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans further lower out-of-pocket expenses for eligible enrollees. These layered programs make California one of the most accessible states for affordable ACA coverage.
