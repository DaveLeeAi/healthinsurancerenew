## Health Insurance Options in Maryland

Maryland operates its own state-based exchange, Maryland Health Connection, for ACA Marketplace enrollment. The state has expanded Medicaid, providing coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. For those above the Medicaid threshold, Maryland Health Connection offers a range of private health plans organized by metal tier. Multiple insurers participate across the state, giving residents a competitive set of options. Maryland's reinsurance program has contributed to premium stability in the individual market.

## How to Enroll in a Maryland Health Connection Plan

Enrollment takes place through the Maryland Health Connection website during the annual Open Enrollment period. The application determines whether a resident is eligible for Medicaid, the Maryland Children's Health Program, or subsidized private coverage through the exchange. Residents who experience qualifying life events can apply during a Special Enrollment Period. The Maryland Health Connection website provides tools for comparing plans side by side, and certified navigators and brokers are available throughout the state to assist with enrollment at no cost.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Maryland

Federal premium tax credits are available to Maryland residents purchasing coverage through Maryland Health Connection, based on household income and local plan costs. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans lower deductibles and copays for those within eligible income brackets. Maryland's state reinsurance program further reduces premiums across the individual market, benefiting all enrollees regardless of subsidy eligibility. These combined programs make Maryland one of the more stable and affordable ACA markets in the country.
