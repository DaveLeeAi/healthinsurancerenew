  - question: "Has Kansas expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act?"
    answer: "Kansas has not expanded Medicaid as of the latest legislative session. This means that adults without dependents in Kansas generally cannot access Medicaid coverage unless they meet traditional eligibility categories, making Marketplace plans a primary coverage option."
  - question: "What types of health plans are available on the Kansas Marketplace?"
    answer: "The Kansas Marketplace offers plans in four metal tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but highest out-of-pocket costs, while Platinum plans have the highest premiums but the lowest cost-sharing."

## Health Insurance Options in Kansas

Kansas residents shop for ACA health insurance through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange. The state has not expanded Medicaid, so the Marketplace serves as the primary source of individual coverage for many Kansans. Plan availability varies across the state's rating regions, with larger metro areas like Kansas City and Wichita typically offering more insurer options. Each plan must cover the ACA's ten essential health benefits, including preventive care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, and mental health services.

## How to Enroll in a Kansas Marketplace Plan

Enrollment for Kansas residents occurs at Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment period. Applicants provide details about their household, income, and any existing coverage to determine eligibility for financial assistance. After the application is complete, available plans are displayed with estimated costs after subsidies. A Special Enrollment Period may be available to those who experience qualifying life events outside of the standard enrollment window. Licensed agents and navigators in Kansas can help walk through the application and plan comparison process at no charge.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Kansas

Premium tax credits play a significant role in making health coverage affordable for Kansas residents. The subsidy amount is based on household income and how it compares to the cost of the second-lowest-cost Silver plan in the local area. Cost-sharing reductions, which apply only to Silver-tier plans, can further reduce deductibles and copays for eligible enrollees. Since Kansas has not expanded Medicaid, residents with incomes just above the poverty level should review their Marketplace options carefully to take full advantage of available financial assistance.
