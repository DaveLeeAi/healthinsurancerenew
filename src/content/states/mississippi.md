## Health Insurance Options in Mississippi

Mississippi residents access ACA health insurance coverage through Healthcare.gov. The state has not expanded Medicaid, which limits coverage options for some low-income adults. The Marketplace offers individual and family plans in the standard metal tiers, though insurer participation in Mississippi has historically been more limited than in larger states. Plan availability varies by county, and residents in some rural areas may have fewer choices. All Marketplace plans cover the ACA's essential health benefits, ensuring baseline coverage standards.

## How to Enroll in a Mississippi Marketplace Plan

Enrollment takes place through Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment period, generally from November 1 through January 15. The application collects household and income information to determine eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, or subsidized Marketplace coverage. Residents who experience qualifying life events outside of Open Enrollment may apply during a Special Enrollment Period. Given the complexity of the application, working with a navigator or licensed insurance agent can be helpful, particularly for first-time applicants. These services are available at no cost throughout the state.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Mississippi

Federal premium tax credits can significantly lower the cost of Marketplace plans for Mississippi residents. The subsidy is based on household income and the price of the local benchmark Silver plan, and it is applied directly to monthly premiums. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans reduce deductibles and copays for those with qualifying incomes. Because Mississippi has not expanded Medicaid, these Marketplace subsidies represent the primary form of financial assistance for many residents seeking individual health coverage.
