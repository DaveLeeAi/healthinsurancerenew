## Health Insurance Options in Oregon

Oregon operates the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace as its state-based exchange for ACA coverage. The state has expanded Medicaid through the Oregon Health Plan, covering a significant low-income population with comprehensive benefits. For residents above the Medicaid threshold, the Marketplace offers individual and family plans across the standard metal tiers. Oregon's exchange includes multiple insurers, though plan availability varies by region. The state has been proactive in implementing policies to stabilize its individual market and promote coverage affordability.

## How to Enroll in an Oregon Marketplace Plan

Enrollment for the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace takes place during the annual Open Enrollment period. The application process collects household and income details to determine eligibility for the Oregon Health Plan, CHIP, or subsidized Marketplace coverage. Residents who experience qualifying life events may apply during a Special Enrollment Period outside the standard enrollment window. Oregon has an extensive network of community partners, certified application assisters, and licensed insurance agents who help residents navigate the enrollment process at no charge.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Oregon

Federal premium tax credits are available to Oregon residents who purchase coverage through the Marketplace, with amounts based on household income and the cost of the local benchmark Silver plan. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver-tier plans lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for enrollees within certain income ranges. Oregon's Medicaid expansion through the Oregon Health Plan provides comprehensive, low-cost coverage for lower-income residents. The state also explores additional measures to improve affordability, making Oregon one of the more active states in addressing health coverage costs.
