## Health Insurance Options in Washington

Washington operates its own state-based exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder, for ACA Marketplace enrollment. The state has expanded Medicaid through Washington Apple Health, providing comprehensive coverage to low-income adults. For residents above the Medicaid income limit, Washington Healthplanfinder offers private health plans across the standard metal tiers. The state has also introduced Cascade Care plans, which are standardized options designed to improve transparency and affordability. Multiple insurers participate across Washington's rating regions, with the Puget Sound area generally offering the widest selection.

## How to Enroll in a Washington Healthplanfinder Plan

Enrollment takes place through the Washington Healthplanfinder website during the annual Open Enrollment period. The application collects household and income information to determine eligibility for Washington Apple Health, CHIP, or subsidized Marketplace coverage. Residents who experience qualifying life events can apply during a Special Enrollment Period. Washington Healthplanfinder provides tools for comparing plans by premium, deductible, network, and total estimated costs. Navigators, enrollment specialists called in-person assisters, and licensed insurance agents are available statewide to help with the application process at no cost.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Washington

Federal premium tax credits are available to Washington residents who purchase coverage through Washington Healthplanfinder, with amounts determined by household income and the local benchmark Silver plan cost. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans lower out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees with qualifying incomes. Washington's Medicaid expansion through Apple Health provides comprehensive coverage for lower-income residents. The Cascade Care program and emerging public option offerings add further layers of affordability to Washington's insurance landscape, making the state one of the more progressive markets for accessible health coverage.
