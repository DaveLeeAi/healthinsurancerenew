## Health Insurance Options in New Mexico

New Mexico operates its own state-based health insurance exchange, beWellnm, for ACA Marketplace enrollment. The state has expanded Medicaid through Centennial Care, offering coverage to a broad low-income population. For residents above the Medicaid income threshold, beWellnm provides access to private health plans across the standard metal tiers. Insurer participation varies by region within the state, and plan options reflect the unique health care landscape of New Mexico, including considerations for rural and frontier communities.

## How to Enroll in a beWellnm Plan

Enrollment occurs through the beWellnm website during the annual Open Enrollment period. The application process determines eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, or subsidized Marketplace coverage based on household and income information. Residents who experience qualifying life events can enroll outside of Open Enrollment through a Special Enrollment Period. beWellnm provides in-person assistance through certified enrollment counselors and licensed insurance agents across the state, including in rural areas where access to coverage resources may be more limited.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in New Mexico

Federal premium tax credits are available to New Mexico residents who purchase coverage through beWellnm, reducing monthly premiums based on income and the cost of the local benchmark Silver plan. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver-tier plans further lower deductibles and copays for qualifying enrollees. New Mexico's Medicaid expansion through Centennial Care also ensures that residents with lower incomes have access to comprehensive coverage at minimal cost. Exploring all available programs through beWellnm helps residents identify the most affordable coverage option.
