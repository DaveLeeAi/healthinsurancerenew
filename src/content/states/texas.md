  - question: "Why does Texas have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country?"
    answer: "Texas has not expanded Medicaid, and its large population includes a significant number of residents who earn too much for traditional Medicaid but may face barriers to accessing Marketplace coverage. These factors contribute to the state's higher-than-average uninsured rate."
  - question: "Are there many insurer options on the Texas ACA Marketplace?"
    answer: "Texas generally has strong insurer participation in its Marketplace, particularly in urban and suburban areas. Major metro regions like Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Austin typically offer plans from multiple carriers, while rural counties may have fewer options."

## Health Insurance Options in Texas

Texas residents access ACA Marketplace coverage through Healthcare.gov. As the second-most-populous state, Texas has one of the largest Marketplace enrollee populations in the country. The state has not expanded Medicaid, which means the Marketplace is a critical source of individual coverage for many Texans. Plan availability spans all metal tiers, and insurer competition is generally robust in major metropolitan areas. Rural areas may experience more limited plan selection. All Marketplace plans in Texas cover the ACA's ten essential health benefits.

## How to Enroll in a Texas Marketplace Plan

Enrollment for Texas residents occurs at Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment period, typically from November 1 through January 15. The application collects household, income, and coverage information to determine eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, or premium tax credits. After completing the application, residents can compare plans by premium, deductible, provider network, and prescription drug coverage. Special Enrollment Periods are available for qualifying life events such as losing coverage, moving, or changes in family size. Texas has a large network of navigators, certified application counselors, and licensed agents who assist with enrollment at no cost.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Texas

Premium tax credits make Marketplace coverage more affordable for a significant number of Texas residents. The credit is based on household income and the cost of the benchmark Silver plan in the local rating area. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans further reduce out-of-pocket costs for enrollees with qualifying incomes. Given that Texas has not expanded Medicaid, these Marketplace subsidies are the primary source of financial assistance for individual health coverage. The large number of participating insurers in many areas also helps drive competitive pricing.
