## Health Insurance Options in Missouri

Missouri residents access ACA Marketplace plans through Healthcare.gov. Following voter-approved Medicaid expansion, the state now provides MO HealthNet coverage to a broader population of low-income adults. For residents above the Medicaid income threshold, the Marketplace offers health plans across Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers. Insurer participation varies by region, with the Kansas City and St. Louis metro areas generally offering more plan choices. All plans on the exchange must cover essential health benefits as defined by the ACA.

## How to Enroll in a Missouri Marketplace Plan

Enrollment for Missouri residents occurs through Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment window. The application process determines whether an individual or family is eligible for MO HealthNet (Medicaid), the Children's Health Insurance Program, or premium tax credits for Marketplace plans. Special Enrollment Periods allow residents to enroll outside of Open Enrollment if they experience qualifying life changes such as loss of coverage, a move, or a change in household size. Certified application counselors and licensed agents throughout Missouri provide free enrollment support.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Missouri

Premium tax credits are available to Missouri residents who purchase coverage through Healthcare.gov, with the amount determined by household income and the cost of the benchmark Silver plan. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver plans further reduce out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees within certain income ranges. With Medicaid expansion now in effect, Missouri residents at the lower end of the income spectrum have access to coverage through MO HealthNet, while those with moderate incomes can benefit from substantial Marketplace subsidies.
