## Health Insurance Options in Michigan

Michigan residents enroll in ACA Marketplace coverage through Healthcare.gov. The state has expanded Medicaid through the Healthy Michigan Plan, which covers a substantial number of low-income adults. For those whose income exceeds the Medicaid threshold, the federal exchange offers individual and family plans across all metal tiers. Michigan's Marketplace includes multiple participating insurers, and plan availability varies by rating region. All Marketplace plans cover the ACA's essential health benefits, including preventive services, maternity care, and prescription drugs.

## How to Enroll in a Michigan Marketplace Plan

Enrollment for Michigan residents takes place at Healthcare.gov during the annual Open Enrollment period, generally running from November 1 through January 15. The application collects information about household members, income, and existing coverage to determine eligibility for the Healthy Michigan Plan, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or subsidized Marketplace plans. Special Enrollment Periods are available for residents who undergo qualifying life events. Community health centers, navigators, and licensed insurance agents across Michigan offer free guidance through the enrollment process.

## Subsidies and Financial Help in Michigan

Federal premium tax credits reduce the cost of Marketplace coverage for eligible Michigan residents. The credit is calculated based on household income relative to the federal poverty level and the local benchmark Silver plan price. Cost-sharing reductions on Silver-tier plans also help lower deductibles and copays for qualifying enrollees. Michigan's Medicaid expansion provides an additional pathway to low-cost coverage, so residents near the income boundary should compare both Medicaid and Marketplace options to determine which program best meets their needs.
