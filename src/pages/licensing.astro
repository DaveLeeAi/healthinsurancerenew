        Health insurance licensing is regulated at the state level. Each state has its own Department of Insurance that oversees agent licensing, continuing education requirements, and consumer protection standards. Agents associated with HealthInsuranceRenew maintain active licenses and carrier appointments as required by the states in which they operate.
