      : `No. As of early 2026, ${stateInfo.name} has not expanded Medicaid under the ACA. This means there may be a coverage gap for adults who earn too much for traditional Medicaid but too little for marketplace premium tax credits. Traditional Medicaid in non-expansion states typically has very low income thresholds.`,
  },
  {
    question: `What ACA savings can I get in ${stateInfo.name} in 2026?`,
    answer: `The same federal premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions are available in ${stateInfo.name} as in other states. Your savings depend on your household income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level, your household size, and the cost of the benchmark Silver plan in your area. People with income between 100% and 400% FPL typically qualify for premium help.`,

  },
  {
    question: `Do I qualify for cost-sharing reductions in ${stateInfo.name}?`,
    answer: `Cost-sharing reductions are a federal benefit available in every state, including ${stateInfo.name}. If your household income is between 100% and 250% of the Federal Poverty Level and you enroll in a Silver plan through the marketplace, you may receive reduced deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket maximums. The amount of savings depends on which CSR tier you fall into.`,

    question: `Can I get Marketplace coverage in ${stateInfo.name} if I lost my job?`,
    answer: `Yes. Losing job-based health coverage is a qualifying life event that triggers a 60-day special enrollment period. You can apply for marketplace coverage in ${stateInfo.name} through ${exchangeName} within 60 days of losing your employer plan. Your new income level may qualify you for premium tax credits that significantly reduce costs compared to COBRA.`,
