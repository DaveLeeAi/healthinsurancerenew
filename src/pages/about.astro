        This site is an educational health insurance resource operated by a licensed insurance agent.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        HealthInsuranceRenew was created to address a common challenge: finding clear, straightforward information about health insurance options under the Affordable Care Act. The ACA marketplace can be difficult to navigate, with complex terminology, shifting enrollment windows, and financial assistance rules that change from year to year. This site exists to make that information more accessible.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Our mission is to provide accurate, unbiased health insurance education at no cost to consumers.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Every guide, tool, and state resource on this site is designed to help individuals and families understand how ACA marketplace coverage works. The content focuses on explaining concepts rather than steering decisions. Topics include how premium tax credits are calculated, what metal tier plans cover, when enrollment periods open, and how state-specific rules may apply. The goal is informed decision-making, not sales pressure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Our approach prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and transparency in everything we publish.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Content is developed and reviewed by professionals with direct experience in ACA health insurance markets. Guides are updated regularly to reflect current-year rules, federal poverty level guidelines, and marketplace changes. When readers are ready to speak with a licensed agent, that option is available -- but the educational content stands on its own regardless.
