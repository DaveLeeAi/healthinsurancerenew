    question: 'What are my health insurance options if I just lost my job?',
    answer: 'You have three main options: enroll in a marketplace plan (often the cheapest if you qualify for subsidies), continue your employer plan through COBRA (same coverage, but you pay the full premium), or apply for Medicaid (if your income is low enough). You have 60 days from losing coverage to act.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is COBRA or a marketplace plan cheaper after losing a job?',
    answer: 'A marketplace plan with subsidies is almost always cheaper. COBRA typically costs $600 to $750 per month for a single person because you pay the full premium. A marketplace Silver plan with tax credits might cost $50 to $300 per month depending on your income. COBRA only makes sense if you are mid-treatment or have met your deductible.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do I have to enroll after losing job-based coverage?',
    answer: 'You have 60 days from the date your employer coverage ends to enroll in a marketplace plan through a Special Enrollment Period. COBRA also has a 60-day election window. Medicaid has no enrollment deadline -- you can apply any time of year.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get free health insurance after losing my job?',
    answer: 'Possibly. If your income after job loss is below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (about ' + fmt(Math.round(g.household_1 * 1.38)) + ' for a single person in 2026) and you live in a Medicaid expansion state, you may qualify for Medicaid, which has minimal to no monthly cost. Even marketplace plans can be $0 per month for very low-income enrollees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I go uninsured while job searching?',
    answer: 'Going uninsured is risky. An unexpected medical event could result in thousands of dollars in bills. Even a brief gap can be dangerous. Marketplace plans with subsidies or Medicaid can provide affordable coverage while you search for a new job.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I get a new job quickly -- should I still sign up for marketplace coverage?',
    answer: 'Yes. Most new employers have a waiting period (up to 90 days) before benefits begin. A marketplace plan or short-term COBRA can bridge that gap. You can cancel marketplace coverage once your employer plan starts.',

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 leading-heading mb-4">Why the Marketplace Is Usually the Best Choice</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-4">
        After losing your job, your projected income for the rest of the year is likely lower than your full-year working income. The marketplace calculates premium tax credits based on your projected annual income, so a mid-year job loss often means you qualify for larger subsidies than you might expect.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-4">
        If your projected income falls below 150% FPL, you may pay $0 per month for a benchmark Silver plan and receive the most generous cost-sharing reductions. Even at higher income levels, marketplace plans with subsidies are typically hundreds of dollars cheaper per month than COBRA.
