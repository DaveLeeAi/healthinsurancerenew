  {
    question: 'What ACA savings do I get if I earn below 138% of the poverty level?',
    answer: 'If you live in a Medicaid expansion state and earn below 138% FPL, you likely qualify for Medicaid, which has minimal or no monthly premiums and very low out-of-pocket costs. In non-expansion states, you may fall into a coverage gap if your income is below 100% FPL.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What ACA help is available between 138% and 200% of the poverty level?',
    answer: 'This income range qualifies for significant help. Your benchmark Silver plan premium is very low (0% to 2% of income), and you qualify for the 87% CSR tier on Silver plans. That means a typical deductible around $650 and an out-of-pocket maximum around $2,900.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I get any help above 400% of the poverty level?',
    answer: 'Under the enhanced subsidy rules (if still in effect for 2026), your premium is capped at 8.5% of household income regardless of how high your income is. Under the original ACA rules, no premium tax credit is available above 400% FPL. Check which rules apply for the year you are enrolling.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know which income band I fall into?',
    answer: 'Calculate your household Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI), then compare it to the Federal Poverty Level for your household size. For example, a single person earning $25,000 in 2026 would be at about 160% FPL. Use our FPL table or the Estimate Your Savings tool for a quick lookup.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does my state affect which income band benefits I receive?',
    answer: 'Premium tax credits and CSR tiers are federal benefits and work the same in every state. However, Medicaid eligibility depends on whether your state has expanded Medicaid. In non-expansion states, the Medicaid threshold is much lower than 138% FPL for adults.',

      The ACA does not give everyone the same level of help. Instead, it uses a sliding scale tied to the <a href="/fpl-2026" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 underline">Federal Poverty Level</a>. The less you earn (relative to your household size), the more assistance you receive. This page explains what to expect at each income band.
