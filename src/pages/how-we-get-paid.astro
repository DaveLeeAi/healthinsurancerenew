        This site may receive commissions from insurance carriers when consumers enroll through licensed agents.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When individuals enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans through a licensed agent associated with this site, the insurance carrier may pay a commission to that agent. This is standard practice in the health insurance industry and is how most agents and brokers are compensated. The commission is paid by the carrier, not the consumer.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        There are no hidden fees, charges, or costs passed on to consumers.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Using this site, its educational content, tools, and calculators is free. Speaking with a licensed agent is also free. If a consumer chooses to enroll in a marketplace plan through an agent, the premium is the same as it would be if the consumer enrolled directly through HealthCare.gov or a state-based exchange. Agent commissions do not increase the cost of the plan.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Compensation does not influence the educational content on this site.
