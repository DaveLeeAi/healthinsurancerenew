        Health Insurance Renew is operated by a licensed health insurance agent recognized by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Marketplace Circle of Champions program. This recognition was awarded for the 2022-2023 Open Enrollment Period based on enrollment volume and consumer service, with $2.9 million in annual premium enrolled through Marketplace coverage.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">What Is the Marketplace Circle of Champions?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The Marketplace Circle of Champions is a recognition program run by the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), a division of CMS. The program identifies agents and brokers across the country who have demonstrated meaningful enrollment activity during the annual Health Insurance Marketplace Open Enrollment Period.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Recognition is based on verified enrollment data. Agents who meet specific thresholds for the number of consumers enrolled and the volume of premium placed through the Marketplace are acknowledged for their contribution to expanding health coverage access.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">2022-2023 Open Enrollment Recognition</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        During the 2022-2023 enrollment cycle, the licensed agent operating Health Insurance Renew enrolled $2.9 million in annual premium through Marketplace coverage. This enrollment activity helped individuals and families in multiple states secure qualified health plans with applicable premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This level of enrollment reflects a commitment to consumer education and enrollment accuracy. Each enrollment involves assessing household income, determining subsidy eligibility, comparing available plan options, and ensuring applications are submitted correctly through the Marketplace system.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">Consumer Impact</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The primary measure of this recognition is consumer impact. Marketplace enrollment connects people with health coverage they might otherwise struggle to obtain on their own. Many consumers who enroll through an agent qualify for significant financial assistance but may not realize they are eligible without professional guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Working with a licensed agent is free to the consumer. Agents are compensated by insurance carriers, not by the individuals they help enroll. This means consumers receive professional enrollment assistance at no additional cost compared to enrolling directly through Healthcare.gov.
      </p>
