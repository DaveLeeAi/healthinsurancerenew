    question: 'Can I get ACA savings if my employer offers health insurance?',
    answer: 'It depends. If your employer plan costs more than about 9.96% of your household income for employee-only coverage, it may be considered unaffordable under ACA rules. In that case, you could qualify for marketplace savings instead. Use our "Does My Employer Plan Count?" tool to check.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What income is used to decide if I qualify for help?',
    answer: 'The marketplace uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). This includes wages, self-employment income, Social Security benefits, and a few other sources. It is not exactly the same as your take-home pay. See our "What Income Counts?" guide for a full breakdown.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I qualify for Medicaid or marketplace savings?',
    answer: 'It depends on your income and your state. In states that have expanded Medicaid, adults with income below about 138% of the Federal Poverty Level generally qualify for Medicaid. Above that, you may qualify for marketplace premium tax credits. In non-expansion states, the thresholds are different.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I missed open enrollment?',
    answer: 'You may still be able to sign up through a Special Enrollment Period if you experienced a qualifying life event -- like losing job-based coverage, getting married, having a baby, or moving to a new state. Medicaid applications are accepted year-round.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get marketplace coverage if I am self-employed?',
    answer: 'Yes. Self-employed individuals can buy coverage through the ACA marketplace and may qualify for premium tax credits based on their projected income. Your income from self-employment counts toward your MAGI for eligibility purposes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there an income limit for ACA premium tax credits?',
    answer: 'Under the enhanced subsidy rules (if still in effect for 2026), there is no hard income cutoff. Instead, your expected premium contribution is capped at 8.5% of your income. Under the original ACA rules, premium help phases out entirely at 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. Check the current rules for the year you are enrolling.',

      ACA eligibility is not a single yes-or-no question. It depends on several pieces of your situation working together. Walk through the sections below to understand where you stand.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1: Employer Coverage -->
    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 leading-heading mb-4">1. Do you have employer coverage?</h2>

          If your employer offers health insurance, that is usually your first option. But having an employer plan does not automatically mean you are locked out of marketplace savings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-3">
          The key question is whether the employer plan is considered <strong>affordable</strong> under ACA rules. If it costs too much relative to your income, you may qualify for marketplace savings instead.

              For 2026, an employer plan is considered affordable if the employee-only premium costs no more than about <strong>9.96%</strong> of your household income. Only the employee-only cost matters for this test -- not the cost to add a spouse or children.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the plan fails this test, you may be able to get marketplace coverage with premium tax credits.

          A larger household size means a higher Federal Poverty Level threshold for the same income, which could mean bigger savings. For example, $40,000 for a single person puts you at a different FPL percentage than $40,000 for a family of four.

          This matters a lot for people with lower incomes. In states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, adults with income below about <strong>138% of the Federal Poverty Level</strong> generally qualify for Medicaid coverage, which has little to no monthly cost.

          In states that have <strong>not</strong> expanded Medicaid, there may be a "coverage gap" -- where your income is too high for traditional Medicaid but too low for marketplace premium tax credits (which start at 100% FPL).
