If employer coverage is deemed unaffordable -- meaning the employee's share of the premium exceeds a set percentage of household income -- marketplace subsidies may become available.","## What Are ACA Subsidies?\n\nACA subsidies are financial assistance programs established by the Affordable Care Act to make marketplace health insurance more affordable. Two primary forms exist: premium tax credits, which reduce monthly premiums, and cost-sharing reductions, which lower out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and copays.\n\n## How Premium Tax Credits Are Calculated\n\nPremium tax credits are calculated based on household income as a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL). The subsidy ensures that the cost of a benchmark Silver plan does not exceed a set percentage of income. Households with lower incomes pay a smaller share, while those with higher incomes receive proportionally less assistance. The credit can be applied in advance to reduce monthly premium payments or claimed in full when filing a federal tax return.\n\n## Understanding Cost-Sharing Reductions\n\nCost-sharing reductions are available exclusively on Silver-tier marketplace plans. These reductions lower the plan's deductible, copayments, and maximum out-of-pocket limits, effectively increasing the plan's actuarial value. Eligibility is generally tied to household incomes between 100% and 250% of the FPL. Unlike premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions do not require reconciliation at tax time.\n\n## What to Watch for in 2026\n\nSubsidy availability in 2026 depends on current federal legislation. Enhanced premium tax credits, which removed the income cap and reduced the maximum percentage of income spent on benchmark premiums, were introduced as temporary measures. Whether these enhancements remain active for the 2026 plan year directly affects how much financial assistance is available.

For individuals or families who expect frequent medical visits, prescriptions, or planned procedures, a higher-tier plan may reduce total annual spending despite the increased premium.","## What Determines Health Insurance Premiums?\n\nHealth insurance premiums on the ACA marketplace are determined by five primary factors: age, geographic location, tobacco use, plan metal tier, and household income (through subsidies). Unlike pre-ACA markets, current regulations prohibit insurers from adjusting premiums based on health status or gender.\n\n## How Age Influences Cost\n\nAge is the most significant individual rating factor for ACA premiums. Older adults are charged higher premiums than younger adults, with federal rules allowing insurers to charge up to three times more for the oldest age band compared to the youngest.

The ACA eliminated pre-existing condition discrimination for all marketplace-compliant plans, so this should not be a deciding factor between the two options.","## Understanding COBRA After Job Loss\n\nCOBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) allows employees who lose their job-based health coverage to continue the same group health plan for a limited period, typically up to 18 months. The critical difference is cost: while employed, the employer typically pays 70% to 80% of the health insurance premium. Under COBRA, the former employee pays 100% of the premium plus a 2% administrative fee.\n\nFor an individual, COBRA premiums commonly range from $600 to $750 per month. For a family, premiums frequently exceed $1,700 per month. These costs represent the full, unsubsidized price of group health insurance and can be a significant financial burden during a period of reduced or no income.\n\n## ACA Marketplace as an Alternative\n\nLosing employer-sponsored health coverage is a qualifying life event that triggers a 60-day Special Enrollment Period on the ACA marketplace. During this window, individuals and families can enroll in marketplace plans and may qualify for premium tax credits based on their projected annual income for the coverage year.\n\nWith reduced income after job loss, many individuals find that marketplace subsidies reduce premiums to well below COBRA costs. A single adult projecting $35,000 in annual income, for example, may pay under $200 per month for a Silver marketplace plan, compared to $650 or more for COBRA. The subsidy is based on projected income for the full year, so a period of unemployment is factored into the calculation.\n\n## Side-by-Side Cost Comparison\n\nWhen comparing COBRA and marketplace options, calculate total annual costs including premiums, deductibles, and expected out-of-pocket spending. COBRA maintains the same deductible progress from the employer plan, which can be valuable if significant medical expenses have already been incurred during the year. Starting a new marketplace plan resets the deductible.\n\nFor individuals with minimal healthcare needs, a marketplace Bronze or Silver plan with subsidies is almost always more affordable than COBRA. For those mid-treatment or with high accumulated deductible spending, a brief period of COBRA followed by a marketplace transition may optimize total costs.\n\n## Timeline and Decision Points\n\nAfter receiving a COBRA election notice, individuals have 60 days to elect COBRA coverage, and this period overlaps with the marketplace special enrollment window. Importantly, COBRA can be elected retroactively within the 60-day window, providing a safety net for unexpected medical expenses during the decision period.\n\nThe recommended approach is to research marketplace options immediately after losing coverage, estimate subsidy eligibility using projected annual income, compare total costs against COBRA premiums, and make an enrollment decision before the 60-day window closes.\n\n## When COBRA Makes Sense\n\nCOBRA may be the better choice in specific situations: when the employer plan has a narrow specialty provider needed for ongoing treatment, when significant deductible spending has already occurred in the current plan year, when the job loss is expected to be very short-term with quick re-employment, or when COBRA premiums are partially subsidized by a severance agreement.","src/content/guides/cobra-vs-marketplace-after-job-loss.md","96a87327dfedfa00",{"html":337,"metadata":338},"\u003Ch2 id=\"understanding-cobra-after-job-loss\">Understanding COBRA After Job Loss\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) allows employees who lose their job-based health coverage to continue the same group health plan for a limited period, typically up to 18 months.

During enrollment on Healthcare.gov or a state exchange, plan listings include links to provider networks. Calling the doctor's office directly to confirm participation in a specific plan is recommended, as online directories may not always be current.",{"question":384,"answer":385},"What is the difference between an HMO and a PPO on the marketplace?","HMO plans generally require members to use in-network providers and get referrals from a primary care physician for specialist visits. PPO plans offer more flexibility to see out-of-network providers without referrals, but at a higher cost. PPO plans tend to have higher premiums than HMOs with similar coverage levels.","## Start with Your Family's Healthcare Needs\n\nBefore comparing plans, assess how your family uses healthcare. Consider the number of doctor visits in a typical year, any ongoing prescriptions, planned procedures or surgeries, and whether any family member has a chronic condition requiring regular specialist visits. Families with minimal healthcare usage prioritize differently than those with predictable medical expenses.\n\nA helpful exercise is to review the past year's medical expenses, including prescriptions, and estimate whether next year will be similar. This baseline helps compare the true cost of each plan tier rather than focusing on monthly premiums alone.\n\n## Understanding Total Cost of Coverage\n\nThe total annual cost of a health plan includes monthly premiums, the deductible, copays for doctor visits and prescriptions, and coinsurance for major services. Two plans with identical premiums can differ by thousands of dollars in total annual costs depending on how much healthcare the family uses.\n\nFor families who rarely visit the doctor, a Bronze plan's low premiums and high deductible may result in the lowest total cost. For families with regular medical needs, a Silver or Gold plan's higher premiums are typically offset by lower per-visit costs and lower maximum out-of-pocket exposure.\n\n## Why Silver Plans Deserve Extra Attention\n\nSilver plans occupy a unique position in the ACA marketplace. They serve as the benchmark for calculating premium tax credits, and they are the only tier eligible for cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Families with income between 100% and 250% of the Federal Poverty Level who select a Silver plan receive enhanced benefits: lower deductibles, reduced copays, and decreased out-of-pocket maximums.\n\nA Silver 94 plan (for income between 100% and 150% FPL) can have a deductible as low as $75 and an out-of-pocket maximum around $1,300, rivaling employer-sponsored coverage. Families eligible for CSRs who choose a Bronze or Gold plan instead forfeit these benefits entirely.\n\n## Network and Formulary Checks\n\nAfter narrowing plan choices by cost, verify that preferred providers are in-network. Marketplace plans use different network types (HMO, PPO, EPO) that affect provider access and referral requirements. Checking the plan's provider directory for primary care physicians, specialists, preferred hospitals, and pharmacies prevents disruptions in ongoing care.\n\nFor families with ongoing prescriptions, reviewing each plan's drug formulary is essential. The same medication may be covered at different tier levels (generic, preferred brand, non-preferred, specialty) across plans, creating significant cost differences. Some plans may require prior authorization or step therapy for certain medications.\n\n## Making the Final Decision\n\nRank the top two or three plans by total estimated annual cost, then factor in network adequacy and prescription coverage. The plan with the lowest total cost that includes preferred providers and covers necessary medications is generally the strongest choice. When plans are closely matched on cost, the broader network or better prescription coverage typically tips the decision.","src/content/guides/how-to-choose-health-plan.md","b3ca94d9c87081c8",{"html":390,"metadata":391},"\u003Ch2 id=\"start-with-your-familys-healthcare-needs\">Start with Your Family’s Healthcare Needs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Before comparing plans, assess how your family uses healthcare.

Two plans with identical premiums can differ by thousands of dollars in total annual costs depending on how much healthcare the family uses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For families who rarely visit the doctor, a Bronze plan’s low premiums and high deductible may result in the lowest total cost.

They serve as the benchmark for calculating premium tax credits, and they are the only tier eligible for cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Families with income between 100% and 250% of the Federal Poverty Level who select a Silver plan receive enhanced benefits: lower deductibles, reduced copays, and decreased out-of-pocket maximums.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A Silver 94 plan (for income between 100% and 150% FPL) can have a deductible as low as $75 and an out-of-pocket maximum around $1,300, rivaling employer-sponsored coverage.

Checking the plan’s provider directory for primary care physicians, specialists, preferred hospitals, and pharmacies prevents disruptions in ongoing care.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For families with ongoing prescriptions, reviewing each plan’s drug formulary is essential.

ACA marketplace plans are private health insurance policies available through Healthcare.gov or state exchanges, with federal subsidies that reduce premiums based on income. The fundamental difference is cost structure: Medicaid has minimal out-of-pocket expenses, while marketplace plans involve monthly premiums, deductibles, copays, and coinsurance even with financial assistance.\n\nIn states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, adults with household income up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level generally qualify for Medicaid. Above that threshold, individuals typically transition to marketplace plan eligibility with premium tax credits. In non-expansion states, the income threshold for Medicaid remains much lower, and a coverage gap may exist for adults earning above traditional Medicaid limits but below 100% FPL.\n\n## Eligibility and Income Thresholds\n\nFor a single adult in 2026, 138% of the Federal Poverty Level is approximately $21,597 in expansion states. Marketplace premium tax credits generally begin at 100% FPL (approximately $15,650 for a single adult) and extend through all income levels under current enhanced subsidy rules, with the maximum expected contribution capped at 8.5% of household income.\n\nHousehold size significantly affects both programs. A family of four with income below approximately $44,367 may qualify for Medicaid in expansion states, while marketplace subsidies would apply above that level. Income is measured as Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI), which includes wages, self-employment income, Social Security benefits, and certain other income sources.\n\n## Choosing Between Programs\n\nFor individuals near the income boundary, the choice between Medicaid and marketplace coverage often depends on income stability, provider preferences, and healthcare needs. Those with predictable income below the Medicaid threshold benefit from the program's minimal cost-sharing. Those with income that may fluctuate above the threshold should consider the implications of mid-year transitions between programs.\n\nMarketplace Silver plans with cost-sharing reductions offer a middle ground for those with income between 100% and 250% FPL, providing reduced deductibles and copays that approach Medicaid-level cost-sharing while maintaining access to broader provider networks.\n\n## The Medicaid Coverage Gap\n\nIn states that have not expanded Medicaid, adults without children or with income above very low traditional thresholds may fall into a coverage gap where they earn too much for Medicaid but too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies. Individuals in this situation should check whether their state has plans to expand Medicaid or explore other coverage options such as community health centers, short-term plans, or healthcare sharing ministries.","src/content/guides/medicaid-vs-marketplace-2026.md","1822e59cb658642f",{"html":443,"metadata":444},"\u003Ch2 id=\"how-medicaid-and-marketplace-coverage-differ\">How Medicaid and Marketplace Coverage Differ\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families.

The deduction reduces AGI, which can increase the subsidy, which in turn reduces the deductible premium. IRS Worksheet W in the Form 8962 instructions provides the iterative method for calculating both correctly. Tax software typically handles this automatically.","## Marketplace Coverage for Freelancers and Gig Workers\n\nThe ACA marketplace is the primary source of individual health insurance for self-employed workers, freelancers, independent contractors, and gig economy participants. Unlike employer-sponsored coverage, marketplace plans are purchased directly, and the full premium is the individual's responsibility. However, premium tax credits based on income can reduce costs substantially.\n\nSelf-employed individuals apply through Healthcare.gov or their state exchange during open enrollment or during a special enrollment period triggered by a qualifying event. The application process requires an estimate of annual household income, which determines the advance premium tax credit applied monthly to reduce the plan premium.\n\n## Managing Variable Income\n\nThe most significant challenge for self-employed marketplace enrollees is accurately projecting annual income. Freelance and gig income fluctuates monthly, and the subsidy is calculated on projected annual MAGI. Overestimating income results in a smaller advance credit (and a refund at tax time), while underestimating results in a larger advance credit that may need to be partially repaid when filing taxes.\n\nBest practices include basing projections on the most recent tax return, adjusting for known changes in contracts or business conditions, and updating the marketplace estimate mid-year if income deviates significantly from the original projection. The marketplace allows income updates at any time, which adjusts the monthly premium credit going forward.\n\n## The Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction\n\nSelf-employed individuals can deduct 100% of health insurance premiums paid for themselves and their dependents as an above-the-line deduction on their federal tax return (IRS Form 1040, Schedule 1). This deduction reduces adjusted gross income, which can in turn increase ACA subsidy eligibility in a circular calculation.\n\nThe deduction applies to the net premium after subtracting the advance premium tax credit. For example, if the full Silver plan premium is $600 per month and the advance credit covers $400, the deductible amount is $200 per month ($2,400 annually). This deduction is available regardless of whether the self-employed individual itemizes deductions.\n\n## HSA Strategy for Self-Employed Workers\n\nSelf-employed individuals enrolled in HSA-eligible high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) can contribute to a Health Savings Account, gaining a triple tax advantage: contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. For 2026, individual HSA contribution limits are projected at approximately $4,300, and family limits at approximately $8,550.\n\nPairing a Bronze HDHP with an HSA allows self-employed workers to maintain low monthly premiums while building a tax-advantaged fund for medical expenses. HSA contributions also reduce MAGI, potentially increasing ACA subsidy eligibility. This strategy works best for relatively healthy individuals who can tolerate the higher deductible in exchange for premium savings and tax benefits.\n\n## Choosing Between Plan Tiers\n\nFor self-employed workers with predictable, moderate income, Silver plans with cost-sharing reductions (for those below 250% FPL) typically offer the best value. For higher earners with minimal healthcare needs, a Bronze HDHP with HSA provides the lowest premium and tax optimization. Gold plans suit self-employed individuals with ongoing treatment needs or expensive prescriptions where the lower cost-sharing offsets the higher premium.","src/content/guides/self-employed-health-insurance-2026.md","a2528b4c2d381b26",{"html":493,"metadata":494},"\u003Ch2 id=\"marketplace-coverage-for-freelancers-and-gig-workers\">Marketplace Coverage for Freelancers and Gig Workers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The ACA marketplace is the primary source of individual health insurance for self-employed workers, freelancers, independent contractors, and gig economy participants.

An unexpected medical event could result in thousands of dollars in bills. A short-term marketplace plan or COBRA can bridge the gap. If the new job offers health benefits, there is typically a waiting period of up to 90 days before employer coverage begins.","## Your Three Main Options\n\nWhen you lose your job and the health insurance that came with it, you generally have three paths: continue your employer plan through COBRA, sign up for a marketplace plan, or apply for Medicaid. Each option has different costs, coverage levels, and deadlines. Understanding the differences helps you pick the one that fits your situation and budget.\n\nThe most important thing to know is that you have a limited time to act. Losing job-based coverage opens a 60-day window called a Special Enrollment Period. If you miss it, you may not be able to get coverage until the next open enrollment season.\n\n## COBRA: Keeping Your Old Plan\n\nCOBRA lets you stay on your employer's health plan for up to 18 months after leaving your job. The coverage stays the same -- same doctors, same benefits, same network. But the cost changes dramatically. While you were employed, your employer likely paid 70% to 80% of the premium. Under COBRA, you pay the entire amount, plus a 2% administrative fee.\n\nFor a single person, that typically means $600 to $750 per month. For a family, it can easily top $1,700 per month. COBRA makes sense in a few specific situations: if you are in the middle of treatment with a specific doctor, if you have already met a large deductible that year, or if a severance package covers COBRA costs.\n\n## Marketplace Plans: Often the Better Deal\n\nThe ACA marketplace (Healthcare.gov or your state exchange) offers health plans with potential savings based on your income. After losing your job, your projected annual income for the year may be lower, which means you could qualify for larger premium tax credits that bring your monthly cost well below COBRA rates.\n\nA single adult projecting $35,000 in annual income might pay under $200 per month for a Silver marketplace plan, compared to $650 or more for COBRA. If your income has dropped significantly, you could qualify for even larger savings, or potentially Medicaid.\n\nTo enroll, visit Healthcare.gov or your state exchange, report the loss of employer coverage, and provide your estimated income for the year. The system will show you available plans and your estimated monthly cost after any credits are applied.\n\n## Medicaid: Free or Very Low-Cost Coverage\n\nIf your income after job loss is low enough, you may qualify for Medicaid. In states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, single adults with annual income below about $21,597 (138% of the Federal Poverty Level for 2026) generally qualify. A family of four may qualify with income below about $44,367.\n\nMedicaid coverage has little to no monthly premiums and very low out-of-pocket costs. In many states, the application process happens automatically when you apply through the marketplace -- if your income qualifies, you are redirected to your state's Medicaid program.\n\nNot all states have expanded Medicaid. In non-expansion states, adults without children may not qualify even at very low income levels.\n\n## Cost Comparison at a Glance\n\nThe actual numbers depend on your income, family size, and location, but here is a general picture for a single adult:\n\n- **COBRA**: $600 to $750 per month (full premium, no help from employer)\n- **Marketplace Silver plan with subsidies**: $50 to $300 per month (varies by income)\n- **Medicaid**: $0 to minimal per month (if income qualifies)\n\nUse the Estimate Your Savings tool on this site to get a rough idea of your marketplace costs based on your income.\n\n## Deadlines That Matter\n\n- **60 days** from losing coverage: deadline to enroll in a marketplace plan through a Special Enrollment Period\n- **60 days** from COBRA election notice: deadline to elect COBRA continuation\n- **No deadline for Medicaid**: you can apply any time of year if you think you may qualify\n- **COBRA is retroactive**: you can elect it within 60 days and it covers you back to the date you lost employer coverage\n\nThe safest approach is to research marketplace options immediately and make a decision within the first few weeks.

Understanding the differences helps you pick the one that fits your situation and budget.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most important thing to know is that you have a limited time to act. Losing job-based coverage opens a 60-day window called a Special Enrollment Period. If you miss it, you may not be able to get coverage until the next open enrollment season.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"cobra-keeping-your-old-plan\">COBRA: Keeping Your Old Plan\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>COBRA lets you stay on your employer’s health plan for up to 18 months after leaving your job. The coverage stays the same — same doctors, same benefits, same network. But the cost changes dramatically. While you were employed, your employer likely paid 70% to 80% of the premium. Under COBRA, you pay the entire amount, plus a 2% administrative fee.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For a single person, that typically means $600 to $750 per month. For a family, it can easily top $1,700 per month. COBRA makes sense in a few specific situations: if you are in the middle of treatment with a specific doctor, if you have already met a large deductible that year, or if a severance package covers COBRA costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"marketplace-plans-often-the-better-deal\">Marketplace Plans: Often the Better Deal\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The ACA marketplace (Healthcare.gov or your state exchange) offers health plans with potential savings based on your income. After losing your job, your projected annual income for the year may be lower, which means you could qualify for larger premium tax credits that bring your monthly cost well below COBRA rates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A single adult projecting $35,000 in annual income might pay under $200 per month for a Silver marketplace plan, compared to $650 or more for COBRA. If your income has dropped significantly, you could qualify for even larger savings, or potentially Medicaid.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To enroll, visit Healthcare.gov or your state exchange, report the loss of employer coverage, and provide your estimated income for the year. The system will show you available plans and your estimated monthly cost after any credits are applied.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"medicaid-free-or-very-low-cost-coverage\">Medicaid: Free or Very Low-Cost Coverage\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>If your income after job loss is low enough, you may qualify for Medicaid. In states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, single adults with annual income below about $21,597 (138% of the Federal Poverty Level for 2026) generally qualify. A family of four may qualify with income below about $44,367.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Medicaid coverage has little to no monthly premiums and very low out-of-pocket costs. In many states, the application process happens automatically when you apply through the marketplace — if your income qualifies, you are redirected to your state’s Medicaid program.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not all states have expanded Medicaid.
